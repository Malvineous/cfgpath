/** Get an absolute path to a single configuration file, specific to this user.

 * This function is useful for programs that need only a single configuration
 * file.  The file is unique to the user account currently logged in.
 *
 * Output is typically:
 *
 *   Windows: C:\Users\jcitizen\AppData\Roaming\appname.ini
 *   Linux: /home/jcitizen/.config/appname.conf
 *   Mac: /Users/jcitizen/Library/Application Support/appname.conf
 *
 * @param out
 *   Buffer to write the path.  On return will contain the path, or an empty
 *   string on error.
 *
 * @param maxlen
 *   Length of out.  Must be >= MAX_PATH.
 *
 * @param appname
 *   Short name of the application.  Avoid using spaces or version numbers, and
 *   use lowercase if possible.
 *
 * @post The file may or may not exist.
 * @post The folder holding the file is created if needed.

/** Get an absolute path to a configuration folder, specific to this user.
 *
 * This function is useful for programs that need to store multiple

 * need to be created) suitable for storing a number of files.
 *
 * The returned path will always end in a platform-specific trailing slash, so
 * that a filename can simply be appended to the path.
 *
 * Output is typically:
 *
 *   Windows: C:\Users\jcitizen\AppData\Roaming\appname\
 *   Linux: /home/jcitizen/.config/appname/
 *   Mac: /Users/jcitizen/Library/Application Support/appname/

/** Get an absolute path to a data storage folder, specific to this user.

 *
 * This path should be used for persistent, important data files the user would
 * want to keep.  Do not use this path for temporary files, cache files, or
 * other files that can be recreated if they are deleted.  Use
 * get_user_cache_folder() for those instead.
